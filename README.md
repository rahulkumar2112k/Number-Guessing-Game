# Number-Guessing-Game
The Number Guessing Game is a fun and simple game where the player attempts to guess a random number within a given range. In this version, players need to guess a number between 1 and 100. They have a maximum of 10 attempts to find the correct number. After each guess, the game provides feedback, indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. The goal is to guess the number in the fewest attempts possible.

With each incorrect guess, players are given hints to help them get closer to the correct number. Once the player guesses correctly or uses all their attempts, the game ends, and they can start over for another round of fun!

2. You have 10 attempts to guess the number.
